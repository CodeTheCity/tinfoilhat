## CHALLENGE 

Pulling in FOI responses from various public body's disclosure logs so they can be searched and analysed. 

Iain Learmonth (and some others) worked on this at the last code the city and produced scrapers to get the high level data from Aberdeen City Council and East Lothian Council. That work is at https://github.com/irl/foiawiki 

To take this forward we wanted to get the scrapers live again, add something to get the text out of the actual response documents and look at putting in an interface to search/look at the data.  

## RESULTS

We've got a name for the project that isn't wrong (this is *not* a wiki). 

The scrapers from the last code the city have been resuscitated and cleaned up a bit. 

There is a website to look at/search the scraped data: http://tinfoil.bodaegl.com

We've got an OCR service that if given the URL of a PDF will respond with the text that's in it.
